  My name is Spencer C. Imbleau and I am a currently a software engineer at NASA with a lot of Danish pride and a family in Vejen! I am applying for the position of \href{https://www.lego.com/en-us/careers/job/60948993}{\myuline{Digial Platforms Engineer (60948993)}}.
}
\letterparagraph{
  I want to perform \textit{very} high for LEGO because I believe in the impacts Lego makes on children accentuate a philosophy I resonate with; service and happiness to others. I believe my knowledge and experience as a software engineer working on the \textit{most} complex system in history right now, coupled with my commercial system engineering experience for a Fortune 1000 company, I can be a proud asset to LEGO.

\letterparagraph{
  I knew when I saw this position, I had to apply. I believe I have what it takes, with experience in \textit{all} of the requirements for this position. I am proficient at building APIs, with \href{https://github.com/simbleau?tab=repositories}{\myuline{many open source contributions}} published. I have been programming since my age was a single digit, and my programming language breakdown can be seen \href{https://github.com/simbleau}{\myuline{here}}. Today all of my current research includes CI/CD with GitHub actions as my personal choice for budgeting. I run a \href{https://github.com/simbleau/home-ops}{\myuline{kubernetes cluster at home}} in a laboratory where I practice IaC with Ansible, Terraform, GitHub Actions, Flux, Renovate, and Age for encrypting secrets. I am well versed with API gateways, event brokers, and OAuth having coded several messaging bots as well as developing for the telemetry communication for the Space Launch System used in the Artemis mission at NASA.

  Nothing would mean more to me than to fulfill a happy life closer to family in Billund, while bringing my knowledge and volunteer initiatives to Denmark. I am so proud of LEGO and where we can go.
