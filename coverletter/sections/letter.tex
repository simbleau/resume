\opening{Blue Origin}

\letterparagraph{
  With a strong bias for automating everything, my name is Spencer C. Imbleau and I am applying to be your next Site Reliability Engineer (\href{https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3035038498}{\myuline{listing}}). I am currently a DevOps Software Engineer supporting NASA on the Space Coast at Kennedy Space Center and I'm excited to use my skills to contribute to Blue's missions.

\letterparagraph{
  Fortunately, the skills Blue is seeking have heavy overlap in my current duties and experience. I work on Artemis and am the responsible party for installing and managing NASA's RKE2 bare-metal Kubernetes cluster. Alongside K8s experience, I write Ansible playbooks for our provisioning and automation, containerize our CI/CD pipelines with Docker, and maintain infrastructure like a private GitLab and Artifactory depot. I lead several team projects, such as the integration of DataDog for Kubernetes and the software design and implementation of data processing and backend systems. Before working at NASA, I was an enterprise systems engineer working for a Linux and Unix engineering team, maintaining an on-site data center and virtualization for the company. I have a great background in Linux and managing infrastructure, whether containerized, virtualized, or bare-metal.

  Outside of work, I \href{https://github.com/simbleau/home-ops}{\myuline{self-host kubernetes at home}}, atop a bare-metal k3s cluster, following IaC and GitOps practices. Even \href{https://github.com/simbleau/resume}{\myuline{this résumé}} is automated using GitOps and CD. My passions at home are the same inside the office. I am not only a technology enthusiast, but a learning enthusiast. In my spare time outside work, I am a recognized contributor to the \href{https://thanks.rust-lang.org/rust/all-time/}{\myuline{Rust programming language}}, I write \href{https://simbleau.github.io/blog/}{\myuline{technical blogs}}, code many projects \href{https://github.com/simbleau}{\myuline{(about 43\% Rust, 41\% Python, and 13\% in Java)}}, and am a hobbyist writing \href{https://github.com/simbleau/nbody-wasm-sim}{\myuline{GPU-based astrophysics simulations}}. I have a Master's degree in Computer Science with a concentrations in Systems and Mathematics, and have been coding since I was around 8 years old.

  I want you to know that I am someone who wants to raise the bar at Blue Origin, and would ask you consider me for this position. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing back.
