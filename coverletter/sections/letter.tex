\letterparagraph{
  My name is Spencer C. Imbleau and I am applying for the PhD fellowship in \href{https://employment.ku.dk/phd/?show=156170}{\myuline{Human-Centered Computing (156170)}}.
}
\letterparagraph{
  Firstly, I would like to state my belief that research on whether the hybrid collaboration model society utilizes today has exhausted its usefulness is a highly impactful subject. The workplace is actively battling retention and attrition as a symptom of this plight, and doing so with limited guidance. With new perspective and experimentation, we can visualize a future which couples hybrid work experiences more efficiently with proveable evidence.
}
\letterparagraph{
  I have taught labs and classrooms, studied as a graduate student, and worked both in person and remotely. Currently I am a hybrid software engineer with some management responsibilities at NASA. These experiences have provided me a multi-faceted perspective.

\letterparagraph{
  Professionally, I have native English skills and a multi-disciplinary background. I have a Master's degree in Computer Science with concentrations in mathematics and systems. At home I have been exposed to art my entire life, as my mother is a career artist with an MFA. My theses have also constituted experience towards graphics and art, with heavy research into user experience and graphics. Lastly, my career has provided me experience in system design as a Systems Engineer and as an analyst of NASA's Space Launch System. I would be an infallible asset to this project with my expertise in prototyping, design, and data collection.
}
\letterparagraph{While not directly related, I work on the most complex software systems ever built right now. I graduated from some of the most aggressive American universities for Computer Science, always as a recipient of honors. I have reciprocal passion for artists, and offer a life-long commitment supported by an art-centric environment, naturally adopted through osmosis. This position requires independent research driven to synthesize theories with proveable evidence, and I would be the right choice.

\letterparagraph{
  Thank you for your time and consideration for this position!
