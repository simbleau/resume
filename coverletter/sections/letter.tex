\letterparagraph{
  My name is Spencer C. Imbleau and I am applying for the position of
  \href{https://www.lego.com/en-us/careers/job/60452730}{\myuline{Software
  Engineer (DK14139)}}. I am currently a Software Engineer at NASA with Danish
  pride, working on the Artemis mission!
}
\letterparagraph{
  I am dedicated and passionate when I say that I have always wanted to support
  LEGO's principles: \textbf{children}, \textbf{people}, and the
  \textbf{environment}. Only the best is good enough. I believe in LEGO's
  impacts, and with my knowledge and experience as an engineer, both on the
  most complicated systems ever built at NASA, and as a systems engineer for a
  Fortune 1000 company, I am confident I can be an asset to LEGO's rich culture
  and principles. I am proud of our commitments and impact worldwide.
}
\letterparagraph{
  With experience in many of LEGO's technologies, I believe I can quickly rise
  to any challenge. I have expertise in Docker, Kubernetes, Python, JavaScript,
  Git, and CI/CD. I even deployed NASA's RKE2 kubernetes cluster for the
  Artemis mission, and I self-host \href{https://github.com/simbleau/home-ops}
  {\myuline{my own bare-metal kubernetes cluster}} inside my home laboratory,
  following Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices. I also have
  experience with Yew and Vue, which follow a similar paradigm to React.
  Moreover, I am a tech enthusiast, and love to learn, contribute, and teach!
  I consider myself highly adaptive and surprise those around me with a smile
  and exceptional work ethic.
}
\letterparagraph{
  Lastly, I've arranged some awesome photos so that you may know me more
  personally! (Did you know the launch director at NASA has a mini-figure?)
  I hope to continue this conversation soon. Thank you for your time and
  consideration for this position!
