\letterparagraph{
  My name is Spencer C. Imbleau and I am applying for the position of
  \href{https://www.lego.com/en-us/careers/job/60438922}{\myuline{Software
  Engineer - Copenhagen (DK13563)}}. I am currently a Software Engineer at NASA with Danish
  pride, and served as a systems engineer, developer, and researcher before that.
}
\letterparagraph{
  I am dedicated and passionate when I say that I have always wanted to support
  LEGO's principles: \textbf{children}, \textbf{people}, and the
  \textbf{environment}. Only the best is good enough, and I believe in LEGO's
  impacts. With my knowledge and experience as an engineer, both on the
  most complicated systems ever built at NASA, and as a systems engineer for a
  Fortune 1000 company, I am confident I can be an asset to LEGO's rich culture
  and principles. LEGO's profound commitments and company values are the
  primary motivation for my application.

\letterparagraph{
  I have certified expertise in reliability engineering (to NASA's highest
  standards), extensive knowledge implementing CI/CD and testing, and
  implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Particularly, I work a lot with
  Docker, Kubernetes, Python, and Rust. I deployed NASA's production kubernetes
  cluster for the current Artemis mission, and I self-host
  \href{https://github.com/simbleau/home-ops}
  {\myuline{my own bare-metal kubernetes cluster}} inside a home laboratory,
  following Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices.
}
\letterparagraph{
  Before this, I was a commercial systems engineer. I designed and developed
  many customer-facing accessible technologies, such as training kiosks and
  time clocks. Complete system design is among my competences, and I do so
  with a carefulness to budget.

  {\myuline{My home lab doesn't cost a kroner}}.

\letterparagraph{
  As a tech enthusiast with experience teaching for a university,
  I love learning, contributing, and teaching. I want to bring fresh
  inspiration and innovation as we set out to drive distribution and
  automation to the next level. I've arranged some awesome photos so that you
  may know me more personally! (Did you know the launch director at NASA has a mini-figure?)
  Thank you for your time and consideration for this position!
