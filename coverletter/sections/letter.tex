\letterparagraph{
  With a strong bias for performance and user experience, my name is Spencer C. Imbleau. I am applying for Enterprise SWE (\href{https://blueorigin.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/BlueOrigin/job/Software-Development-Engineer--Mid-Career----Enterprise-Technology_R23113-1}{\myuline{listing}}). Today I support NASA on the Space Coast as a DevOps Software Engineer, and I would like to provide facts and examples for how I can bring the desired skills to a career at Blue Origin.

  Let's start with React. I am a recognized contributor to the \href{https://thanks.rust-lang.org/rust/all-time/}{\myuline{Rust programming language}}, and I work to contribute to tooling around the most known, reactive front-end library, \href{https://yew.rs/}{\myuline{Yew}}. There's a lot to unpack here, but Yew is a blazingly fast successor to React. I also maintain \href{https://trunkrs.dev/}{\myuline{Trunk}}, a CLI to build WebAssembly in Rust, and endorsed by Yew. With attentiveness to speed and analytics, I sometimes write \href{https://spencer.imbleau.com/}{\myuline{technical blogs}} on Front-end, UI, Rust, and DevOps. I am captivated with advancing the performance of web-based applications. Unsurprisingly, I have also defended a thesis on GPU-accelerated graphics targeting front-end usage.

  I am a programming languages person, currently averaging ~\href{https://github.com/simbleau}{\myuline{(43\% Rust, 41\% Python, and 13\% in Java)}}. I have work on the front page of Google, Mozilla, and Apple's \href{https://wgpu.rs/}{\myuline{WebGPU initiative}} to bring GPU accessibility to the Web, and I pioneered one of the first GPU-accelerated front-end astrophysics simulations - \href{https://simbleau.github.io/nbody-wasm-sim/}{\myuline{Please take a peek!}}. I am also volunteering in a passionate working group, specializing in the cross-section of bringing Rust to Aerospace. I have a master's degree in Computer Science with concentrations in Systems and Mathematics, among a lifelong journey of coding.

  At NASA, I work on data processing systems for Artemis and I am the responsible party for the installation and management of NASA's bare-metal Kubernetes cluster. I \href{https://github.com/simbleau/home-ops}{\myuline{self-host Kubernetes at home}}, atop a bare-metal k3s cluster, following best practices in IaC and GitOps. Even \href{https://github.com/simbleau/resume}{\myuline{this coverletter}} is automated. I want to bring my experience in Docker, SCM, and DevOps infrastructures as a strategic advantage, increasing productivity on the frontend. Before my work at NASA, I was an enterprise systems engineer working for a Linux and Unix engineering team, maintaining an on-site data center, programming accessible technologies, and providing corporate virtualization.

  I'd love to discuss further and ask for consideration in this position. I am someone who wants to raise the bar at Blue Origin, and I thank you for your time.
