\letterparagraph{
  My name is Spencer C. Imbleau and I am applying for the position of
  \href{https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3073436849}{\myuline{Software Engineer (1313922)}}. I am currently a Software Engineer at NASA with Danish
  pride, working on the Artemis mission!
}
\letterparagraph{
  I am dedicated and passionate when I say that I have always wanted to support
  Microsoft's company values: \textbf{innovation}, \textbf{inclusivity}, and the
  \textbf{social responsibility}. Only the best is good enough. I believe in Microsoft's
  impacts, and with my knowledge and experience as an engineer, both on the
  most complicated systems ever built at NASA, and as a systems engineer for a
  Fortune 1000 company, I am confident I can be an asset to Microsoft's rich culture
  and principles.
}
\letterparagraph{
  With experience in many of Microsoft's technologies, I believe I can quickly rise
  to any challenge. I have a strong background in Java, Docker, Kubernetes, Python, Rust,
  and GitOps. I led an initiative for a Fortune 1000 company to modernize automation and 
  I even deployed NASA's RKE2 kubernetes cluster for the
  Artemis mission. In my freetime, I self-host \href{https://github.com/simbleau/home-ops}
  {\myuline{my own bare-metal kubernetes cluster}} inside my home laboratory,
  following Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices.
  Moreover, I am a tech enthusiast, and love to learn, contribute, and teach! My education
  background extends a concentration in Systems and Mathematics, and I consider myself highly
  adaptive and surprise those around me with a smile and exceptional work ethic.

  I've put Clippy here for good measure. Hope it makes your day!
  Thank you for your time and consideration for this position!
